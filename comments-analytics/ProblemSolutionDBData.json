      "text": "Your restaurant could use shower curtains as partitions between tables.\n\n You could also use shower curtains to seperate tables positioned farther away from each other.\n\n This way, they could be easily moved around if needed and would be easy to clean. \n\n Before putting a new party at a table, the curtains could be sprayed or wiped down. \n\nThe curtains would catch any droplets from talking, sneezing, etc. that might come from people eating at a restaurant. \n\nThis will assure customers that it is safe to dine in this restaurant. \n\n\n\n\nIn addition, customers can look up online and order ahead of time. \n\n A waiter will be assigned to a customer by the time the customer gets to a restaurant. \n\n Each waiter should ensure safety by wearing gloves, masks and serves only one table until the customers at the table leave. \n\nOnce the customers leave, the waiter uses a new pair of gloves. \n\n Each waiter also makes sure the customers at their table use hand sanitiser as they finish their dinner and before they leave. \n\nThe waiter is also responsible for cleaning the table, chair well before next customer comes in. \n\nThe restaurant provides an app to any customer who wants to reserve a table and also provides notifications 30, 15, 10 , 5 and 2 minutes prior to table being ready. \n\nWhile the restaurant will operate at half of its capacity, it will still be able to function."
